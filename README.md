# Credit-Risk Scoring ‚Äì Home-Credit Default Risk üöÄ
*Predict the probability that an applicant will default, using open Home-Credit data.*

---

## 1  Problem statement
Lenders need to decide **‚Äúapprove or refuse?‚Äù** within seconds while keeping default losses low and meeting regulatory explainability standards.

> **Goal:** build a reproducible pipeline that ingests the public *Home-Credit Default Risk* dataset, engineers economically meaningful features, trains baseline models (LightGBM/XGBoost), and surfaces explanations (SHAP) suitable for credit-risk governance docs.
